    "Besides introducing multi-tape turing machines, the project makes the connect between language recognition and computation. As an example: we could as for an accept or reject outcome for the three numbers n1, n2, n3, where the accept outcome is only when n3 = n1 + n2. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will produce n3 from n1 and n2, making it more like a standard use of a computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-tape machine will also allow us to introduce many interesting models. Non-deterministic computing can be modeled as a deterministic computation with a read only tape of random numbers. Oracle machines can be introduced where the TM writes a question on a tape and pauses while the question is replaced with an answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "The secret of 2's complement to represent negative numbers is to know that there are not negative or positive numbers at all. The number system is actually the integers modulo N = 2<sup>n</sup> for n bits, and half of these we call negative and half we call positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the integers, given an integer, the other integers are either \"before\" or \"after\" this integer. Those after we count up to. Those before we count down to. However modulo N we can count forward to any other integer, as well could backwards to any other integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the integers modulo N, count back one from 0 gives N-1. For N=16, this means 15. And as,\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "     15 + 1 = 16 = 0 modulo 16\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "then 15 acts like -1. We can decide whether to call it 15 or -1, as suits our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer i modulo N, think of it as a binary number in n bits. It is important we think of the n bits, not just the value of i. Consider the complement of i, &sim; i. The sum of i + &sim; i is obviously whatever value is the n-bit number of all ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    i = 6 =  0101<sub>2</sub>\n",
    "    &sim;i = &sim;0101<sub>2</sub> = 1010<sub>2</sub> = 9\n",
    "    i + &sim;i  = 0101<sub>2</sub> + 1010<sub>2</sub> = 1111<sub>2</sub> = 15\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding one, ignoring the overflow, the result of a number plus its complement is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    i + &sim;i + 1 = 0     modulo N\n",
    "    -i = (&sim;i + 1)    modulo N\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make this look like positive and negative numbers by dividing out the N numbers into N/2 positive numbers, that should include 1, 2, 3 ... and some others; and N/2 negative numbers, which should include -1, -2, -3 ... and some others. We know from two's complement that -1 = 1111<sub>2</sub> in the case of 4 bits, so we conclude that if the most significant bit is 1, let us believe the number is negative; otherwise it is positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can just leave a negative number be, for instance, there is nothing wrong with 1110<sub>2</sub>. However for this assignment I would like you exchange the version of the negative number with the leading bit 1 with a negative indicator (the % replacing the &amp;) followed by the negative of the negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is still an issue, however. In this system,\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    7 + 7 = 14 = -2 modulo 16\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "and that doesn't seem right. Two positives should not add up to a negative. There was an overflow that placed the resulting large positive into the set of integers we call negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is to use enought bits that things do not overflow. Since the largest number with a 0 in the leading bit is N/2-1 (for n = 2, that is the number 0111<sub>2</sub> or 7) we must not add numbers larger than N/4. So we select n to be the number of bits required to represent the larger number we will attempt to add, and put on 2 more bits of precision. Now you can do the two's complement and we will not have arithmetic overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, now 7 + 7 is ok,\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    7 = 00111<sub>2</sub>,\n",
    "    00111<sub>2</sub> = 00111<sub>2</sub>, = 01110<sub>2</sub> = 14\n",

    "And so is -7 + -7, \n",

    "    11001<sub>2</sub> + 11001<sub>2</sub> = 10010<sub>2</sub>\n",
