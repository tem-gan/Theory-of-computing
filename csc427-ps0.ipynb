    "The sorts of machines we are considering are machines that react to inputs, symbolically given here as the presentation to the machine of a letter. That presentation affects the machine in two ways. First, it could do something appropriate to the letter presented. Second, it updates an internal state that keeps the context for how the machine is to react to future inputs.\n",
